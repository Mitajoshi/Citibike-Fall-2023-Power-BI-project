# Citibike Ridership Analysis for Fall 2023 using Power BI 

Introduction:
Since it's establishment in 2013, the Citi Bike program has developed a robust infrastructure for the systematic collection and organization of data pertaining to program utilization. On a monthly basis, a comprehensive dataset is compiled, providing a wealth of bike-related information, and is made publicly accesible through the Citi Bike webpage.

This project is dedicated to the in-depth analysis and visualization of New York Citi Bike ridership data, voluntarily contributed by users. It's essential to acknowledge the potential presence of outliers in the dataset, necessitating meticulous consideration during the phases of data preparation and analysis, conducted with Python code in Jupyter Notebook. The selected data spans the months of October, November and December in the year 2023, offering a focussed exploration of ridership patterns during this specific timeframe. The primary goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights into the utilization patterns of the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. The outcomes of this analysis are intended to serve as valuable contributions toward the ongoing enhancement of the city program.
