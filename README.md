## Introduction:

Since it's establishment in 2013, the Citi Bike program has developed a robust infrastructure for the systematic collection and organization of data pertaining to program utilization. On a monthly basis, a comprehensive dataset is compiled, providing a wealth of bike-related information, and is made publicly accesible through the Citi Bike webpage.

This project is dedicated to the in-depth analysis and visualization of New York Citi Bike ridership data, voluntarily contributed by users. It's essential to acknowledge the potential presence of outliers in the dataset, necessitating meticulous consideration during the phases of data preparation and analysis, conducted with Python code in Jupyter Notebook. The selected data spans the months of October, November and December in the year 2023, offering a focussed exploration of ridership patterns during this specific timeframe. The primary goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights into the utilization patterns of the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. The outcomes of this analysis are intended to serve as valuable contributions toward the ongoing enhancement of the city program.

The number of individuals who participate in the city program is more than twice the count of casual riders, such as tourists.

## Conclusion
In summary, a consistent trend emerges indicating a decline in bike rentals as temperatures drop. Notably, the observed pattern extends to the usage of bikes for shorter distances as the study progresses. This insight is valuable for maintenance considerations, suggesting that the end of the year might present an opportune time to temporarily withdraw batches of bikes for repair and maintenance. This strategic approach aligns with the observed decrease in demand during colder weather, minimizing the impact on user access.

Expanding on previous findings, the analysis of Citi Bike ridership during Fall months revealed a substantial decrease in ridership volume, particularly in November and December. The "Percent Change in Ridership" graph clearly illustrates this decline, with approximately 22.43% fewer riders in November and an almost 40% decrease in December compared to October. This seasonal variation in ridership behavior emphasizes the need for adaptive strategies, such as adjusting bike availability and marketing efforts, to align with changing user patterns.

Furthermore, the examination of Member vs Casual Rider Behavior sheds light on distinct usage patterns. Members predominantly utilize the bike-sharing program during peak office hours, suggesting a focus on daily commutes. In contrast, casual riders show a more varied pattern, with increasing bike rentals throughout the day and a peak during evening hours in Fall. The "Ride Durations" graph underscores the difference in behavior, indicating that, despite fewer casual bike rentals, they engage in longer rides on average compared to members.

The analysis of Electric vs Classic Bike Usage provides valuable insights for operational planning. Classic bikes exhibit higher demand during peak office hours, while Electric bikes maintain a relatively stable demand throughout the day. However, the average trip distance for both types of bikes remains comparable. The breakdown of usage at the top 10 starting stations offers specific information for strategic planning, enabling management to allocate resources effectively based on demand trends.

In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of Citi Bike data not only reveals seasonal variations in ridership but also highlights distinct user behaviors and preferences. These findings provide actionable insights for maintenance scheduling, operational adjustments, and strategic planning to optimize the efficiency of the bike-sharing program.
